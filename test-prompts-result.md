**Customer Message:**
*"I was charged ₹999 today but I thought I was on the Starter plan. Can you explain why this happened?"*

---

**\[BotName] Response:**
Hi! I understand your concern about the unexpected charge. Let me help clarify this for you.

To ensure your account is secure, could you please confirm:

* The **email address** linked to your account (you can share the first 3 characters and domain, e.g., *"joh*\*\*@email.com"\*)
* The **amount of your last payment** and its approximate date

Once verified, I’ll review your subscription tier and billing history.

In general:

* The **Starter plan** is ₹699/month, while the **Pro plan** is ₹999/month.
* If you upgraded from Starter to Pro mid-cycle, a **prorated charge** may have applied.
* Billing happens **monthly on your signup anniversary date**, and changes in plan are reflected automatically.

If this charge was in error or if you upgraded unintentionally, you may be eligible for a **refund under our 30-day money-back guarantee** for new customers.

Once I verify your account, I’ll check if a refund or plan adjustment is applicable.

Let’s sort this out quickly! Could you please share the requested details?

Is there anything else I can help clarify about your billing?

Customer Message:"I just saw a late fee of ₹100 on my bill. Can you tell me why I was charged that?"

---

**\[BotName] Response:**

Hi! I understand how frustrating unexpected charges can be. Let me help you understand this fee.

Our billing policy includes a ₹100 late fee if a payment isn’t completed within 7 days of the billing date. Based on your billing cycle, your last invoice was generated on [insert billing date], and payment was received on [insert payment date], which was past the 7-day grace period.

This triggered the standard late fee as per our policy.

If this was your first late payment, I’d be happy to request a one-time waiver as a courtesy. Let me know if you'd like me to initiate that.

Going forward, I recommend enabling auto-pay or setting a reminder before your billing date to avoid late fees.

Would you like me to help set that up or assist with anything else?

Customer Message:"Can I switch my payment from credit card to UPI?"

---

**\[BotName] Response:**

Great question! Yes, you're welcome to switch your payment method from credit card to UPI anytime.

Here’s how you can do it:

Log in to your [CompanyName] account.

Go to Billing Settings.

Select “Update Payment Method.”

Choose UPI and enter your UPI ID (e.g., yourname@upi).

Confirm the OTP sent to your UPI-linked mobile number.

Once saved, your future subscription payments will be automatically debited via UPI on your billing date.

Note: If you're on the Enterprise plan, you can also use bank transfer as an option.

Would you like me to guide you through the steps or check if your current plan is eligible?

I'll help you understand this billing situation by walking through it step by step.

---

### **STEP 1: SITUATION ANALYSIS**

Let me analyze your billing situation step by step:

* **Type of issue**: Unexpected charge of ₹999
* **Date of charge**: Today
* **Assumed plan**: You expected to be on the **Starter plan** (likely free or lower-cost)
* **Potential causes**: Plan upgrade, free trial ending, multiple accounts, or auto-renewal of a higher-tier plan

---

### **STEP 2: POLICY REVIEW**

Based on our billing policies, here’s what applies:

* **Starter Plan**: Free with limited features, no monthly charges
* **Pro/Plus Plans**: Billed monthly or annually unless downgraded or canceled before renewal
* **Trial Policy**: If you were on a free trial of a paid plan, it auto-renews into a paid subscription unless canceled
* **Billing Notices**: We send renewal reminders 3–7 days before billing

---

### **STEP 3: CALCULATION / INVESTIGATION**

Let me walk through the billing logic:

* A charge of ₹999 corresponds to our **monthly Pro plan** pricing in INR.
* This typically means:

  * You either **upgraded to Pro** manually at some point
  * Or your **free trial on Pro expired** and auto-renewed
* If no downgrade or cancellation happened before the renewal date, the system charged the full monthly fee

---

### **STEP 4: RESOLUTION DETERMINATION**

Considering all factors, here’s my assessment:

* The ₹999 charge likely occurred because your **account was set to auto-renew** on the **Pro plan**
* This is **valid per policy** unless:

  * You didn’t receive proper renewal notice (in which case, escalation is valid)
  * You believe you downgraded in time (we'll need to verify timestamps)
* If this was unintentional or you didn’t use the Pro features, you **may be eligible for a refund**, especially if it’s within 7 days of the charge and no usage occurred

---

### **STEP 5: NEXT STEPS**

Here’s exactly what will happen next:

1. **Verify your identity**: Please share:

   * The **first 3 characters** of your account email (e.g., "ram\*\*\*@domain.com")
   * The **last 4 digits** of your payment method (e.g., “\*\*\*\*1234”)
2. I’ll check:

   * Your **plan change or trial history**
   * Whether a **refund** or **plan correction** applies
3. If refund is approved:

   * Refunds are usually processed in **5–7 business days** back to your original payment method

---

**Conclusion:**
The ₹999 charge is likely a renewal of a **Pro plan** after a trial or upgrade. Let’s verify the details to confirm eligibility for a refund or correction.

**Your Next Steps:**
Please confirm your email prefix and payment method ending in digits, so I can pull up your exact account securely and investigate further.

**Customer Message:**
*"Can I switch my payment from credit card to UPI?"*

---

Yes, you **can switch your payment method from credit card to UPI**, but let me walk you through it step by step to ensure full clarity and a smooth transition.

---

### **STEP 1: SITUATION ANALYSIS**

* **Request**: Change payment method from credit card to UPI
* **Timing**: After a recent charge (₹999 today)
* **Purpose**: Likely to simplify future payments or avoid card charges
* **Possible concern**: How it affects ongoing subscriptions and billing cycles

---

### **STEP 2: POLICY REVIEW**

Here’s what our billing policies state:

* **Payment Method Change**: You can update your method any time from the **billing settings/dashboard**
* **Auto-renewal impact**: If not updated before the next billing date, the system charges the old method
* **UPI Support**: Supported for India-based users via Razorpay/Stripe (interface may vary)

---

### **STEP 3: CALCULATION/INVESTIGATION**

This doesn’t involve proration or new charges **unless**:

* You're switching plans or being billed immediately for a new cycle
* Your current payment method fails and system attempts retry

So, **no additional fees** just for switching to UPI.

---

### **STEP 4: RESOLUTION DETERMINATION**

You can safely:

* Keep your current plan active
* Change the default payment method to UPI
* The new method will be used for **your next billing cycle** (unless you change plans or trigger manual billing)

Important: The UPI change **won’t retroactively apply** to today's ₹999 card charge.

---

### **STEP 5: NEXT STEPS**

Here’s how to proceed:

1. **Go to your Billing/Account Settings**
2. Look for **“Payment Method” or “Billing Info”**
3. Click “**Update Payment Method**”
4. Select **UPI** and enter your UPI ID (like `yourname@upi`)
5. Confirm and authorize via your UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.)

> Once saved, your next charge will use this new method.

---

**Conclusion:**
✅ Yes, you can switch to UPI for future payments
⚠️ Today’s ₹999 card charge won’t be reversed unless a refund is separately approved
🕒 UPI will be used from the **next billing cycle**

Would you like help locating the exact setting in your account, or do you want to initiate a refund request as well?
